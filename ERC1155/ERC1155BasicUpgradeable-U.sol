/** This ERC1155 contract has the below features and therefore is considered a "Complex ERC20 Contract"
Burnable - Token holders will be able to destroy their tokens.
Supply Tracking - Keeps track of total supply of tokens.

UUPS Upgradeability - Uses simpler proxy with less overhead, requires including extra code in your contract. Allows flexibility for authorizing upgrades.
